   You can name it something like "day1", "day2", and so on, to keep track
   of your progress.

   `git checkout -b day1`

5. Solving Problems: Use this template to write your code for solving DSA
   problems. You can use any programming language of your choice. Organize your code in a
   structured manner within the appropriate folders.

6. Problem Descriptions: Add problem descriptions, links, or any additional
   information about the problem you are solving in `SUMMARY.md` or as comments
   in your code.

7. Commit and Push: After solving a problem, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

   and folders from version control.
